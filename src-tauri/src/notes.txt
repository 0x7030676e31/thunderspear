> For each cluster try to preupload, on success:
> Send upload credentials to the async stream

NOTE: each cluster holds at most 250 MiB of data

> Async stream takes at most n clusers and uploads them to the discord.
> After the upload is done, signal is sent to the last section of the upload pipeline.

> The last section of the upload pipeline is responsible for uploading the data to the discord.
> This section is done fully asynchronously without any blocking.

> After the upload is done, the metadata is saved on the local machine.
